## UK-Specific Considerations

When using these templates, always consider:

1. **Currency**: Specify GBP (£) for financial queries
2. **Geography**: Mention UK explicitly, or specify England/Scotland/Wales/Northern Ireland if laws differ
3. **Regulations**: Reference UK-specific laws (GDPR, Consumer Rights Act 2015, Companies Act, etc.)
4. **Sources**: Request .gov.uk, UK regulatory bodies, UK news sources
5. **Spelling**: Use UK English (organisation, colour, analyse, etc.)
6. **Market**: Distinguish UK market from broader European market when relevant
7. **Taxation**: HMRC for tax matters, not IRS
8. **Business structure**: Ltd, PLC, LLP (not Inc, LLC)

## Usage Tips

1. **Replace all bracketed placeholders** with your specific information
2. **Add more context** when your situation has unique UK constraints
3. **Specify current data needs** explicitly (e.g., "Include 2025 UK data" or "Use latest UK market reports")
4. **Request sources** when verification matters: "Include citations from UK sources for key claims"
5. **Iterate** - If results aren't quite right, refine your specifics and resubmit
6. **Geographic specificity** - Specify "UK" even when it seems obvious to avoid US-centric responses
