Several **18U–24U server racks** suitable for a Supermicro 4U full-depth chassis and 12–18U of networking gear are available from UK retailers and eBay. For a Supermicro 4U GPU chassis, you typically need a **rack depth of at least 800mm** (some models require 900–1000mm for cable clearance). Below is a table comparing current options, focusing on **budget-friendly racks under £500**, including new and used/refurbished eBay listings where available.

| Rack Type      | Height (U) | Depth (mm) | Load Capacity | Price (new/used) | Purchase Link | Notes |
|----------------|------------|------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|-------|
| Floor-standing | 18U        | 1000       | 1000kg+       | £350–£500 (used eBay) | eBay UK (search: "18U server rack 1000mm") | Best for full-depth servers, high load, often used/refurb available |
| Floor-standing | 18U        | 800        | 800kg+        | £400–£600 (new) | Server Room Environments[1] | New, high load, cable management, ventilation |
| Wall-mount     | 18U        | 800        | 100kg+        | £472 (new)      | 123Racks[3]  | Custom, 600mm wide, 800mm deep, roof fan, cable mgmt |
| Wall-mount     | 18U        | 600        | 60–100kg      | £240–£350 (new) | Server Room Environments[1], BroadbandBuyer[5], CMW Ltd[6] | May be too shallow for full-depth Supermicro chassis |
| Wall-mount     | 18U        | 600        | 60kg          | £200–£300 (used eBay) | eBay UK (search: "18U wall mount rack 600mm") | Budget, but depth likely insufficient for full-depth server |
| Wall-mount     | 18U        | 600        | 132 lbs (60kg) | £350 (new)      | NavePoint[2] | 600mm depth, cable mgmt, fans, may be too shallow |
| Wall-mount     | 18U        | 600        | 100kg         | £350–£400 (new) | Penn Elcom[4] | 600mm depth, vented, cable mgmt |

**Best Value Options Under £500:**
- **Used/refurbished 18U floor-standing racks, 800–1000mm deep, on eBay UK**: These are the most cost-effective and robust for a full-depth Supermicro chassis and heavy networking gear, with high load capacity and good ventilation. Search for "18U server rack 1000mm" or "18U APC rack" on eBay UK for current listings, often £350–£500 for reputable brands (APC, Prism, generic 19-inch).
- **123Racks Custom 18U Wall-Mount, 800mm deep**: At £472 new[3], this is the only wall-mount option with enough depth for a full-depth server, includes a roof fan and cable management, but check wall suitability for 100kg+ load.
- **Server Room Environments 18U Floor-standing, 800mm deep**: New, from £400–£600[1], with high load and cable management, suitable for small rooms and heavy equipment.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Depth**: Most wall-mount racks are 600mm deep, which is insufficient for a full-depth Supermicro GPU chassis (typically 800mm+ required). Only a few custom or floor-standing racks meet this requirement.
- **Load Capacity**: Wall-mount racks rarely exceed 100kg; floor-standing racks can handle 800–1000kg+, essential for heavy servers and UPS.
- **Cable Management & Ventilation**: All listed racks include cable management features and ventilation (perforated doors, optional fans).
- **Room Size**: 18U racks are ~0.8m tall; 24U racks are ~1.1m. Both fit comfortably in a 2.33m × 2.09m room.

**Purchase Links (examples):**
- eBay UK: Search "18U server rack 1000mm", "APC 18U rack", "Prism 18U rack"
- Server Room Environments: 18U 800mm/1000mm deep floor-standing racks[1]
- 123Racks: Custom 18U 800mm deep wall-mount[3]
- NavePoint: 18U 600mm wall-mount (too shallow for full-depth server)[2]
- Penn Elcom: 18U 600mm wall-mount[4]

**Recommendation:** For a Supermicro 4U GPU chassis and heavy networking gear, a **used/refurbished 18U floor-standing rack, 800–1000mm deep, from eBay UK** offers the best value and safety under £500. Wall-mount options with sufficient depth and load are rare and more expensive.
