- **Wi-Fi Generation**: WiFi 6E
- **Band Support**: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz (tri-band)
- **Max Throughput**: 10.2 Gbps aggregate
- **PoE Standard**: 802.3at PoE+ (PoE injector required)
- **Client Capacity**: 600+ clients

- **Bulk Pricing**: 5+ units at £236.62 each; 10+ units at £232.76 each

## Critical Gaps in Available Data

Unfortunately, the search results do not provide:

1. **Comparative models**: No specifications for U6+, U6-Pro, U7-Pro, or newer 2025 models
2. **Transmit power specifications**: RF output power not listed
3. **Coverage estimates**: No range data for concrete wall penetration scenarios
4. **Black Friday 2025 offers**: No promotional pricing information available
5. **Alternative retailers**: Only partial pricing from two UK suppliers (Network Warehouse and NetXL)
6. **In-wall variant details**: The U6-Enterprise-IW is mentioned but lacks full specifications[6]

## Recommendation

For your concrete construction scenario with 3-4 ceiling-mount APs, the **U6-Enterprise appears suitable** given its 6 GHz support and enterprise-grade performance. However, to complete your procurement task properly, you should:

- Contact Ubiquiti UK directly or check their official store for current model availability and transmit power specifications
- Request RF propagation data specific to concrete wall attenuation
- Contact major UK resellers (Scan.co.uk, Overclockers UK, Ebuyer) for November 2025 Black Friday pricing
- Verify PoE++ compatibility if you plan to use the built-in PoE output feature for downstream devices

The information needed for a comprehensive comparison table with all requested models and current promotional pricing is not available in the provided search results.
