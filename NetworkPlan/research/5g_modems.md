# 5g modems

*Research conducted: 2025-11-14 13:28 UTC*

I appreciate the detailed technical requirements, but I need to be transparent about the limitations of the search results provided. While the search results contain useful information about 5G routers and modems from Teltonika and MikroTik, they don't provide the comprehensive technical specifications, current UK pricing, Black Friday deals, or purchase links necessary to create the detailed comparison table you've requested.

## Available Information from Search Results

The search results do reference several relevant products that could potentially meet your requirements:

**Teltonika Options:**
- **RUTX50**: Flagship 5G router with dual-band WiFi, Gigabit Ethernet ports, and remote management capabilities[1]
- **ATRM50**: Transportation-focused 5G router (released mid-2025) with dual SIM slots, integrated eSIM (up to 7 profiles), GPS, and 4x Gigabit Ethernet M12 ports[2][6]
- **RUTM54**: High-end 5G router with dual SIM slots and integrated eSIM[2]

**MikroTik Options:**
- **Chateau 5G R17 ax**: Home/small business 5G router with full eSIM support, WiFi 6, and Gigabit Ethernet ports[2][3]
- **Outdoor 5G device**: MikroTik's first outdoor 5G device with built-in eSIM support, directional antennas, Release 16 modem, Gigabit Ethernet, PoE-in, and IP66 certification[3]

## Critical Information Gaps

The search results do not provide:

- Specific UK 5G band support details (n1, n3, n7, n20, n28, n38, n78 compatibility)
- External antenna connector types (TS9, SMA, N-type specifications)
- Current November 2025 UK pricing
- Black Friday 2025 deals or promotions
- Direct purchase links from UK retailers
- Detailed antenna specifications (gain ratings, connector types, outdoor mounting options)
- Compatibility verification with Ubiquiti UniFi gateways
- Comparison of Peplink options (mentioned but not detailed)

## Recommendation

To obtain the comprehensive technical specifications and current pricing you need, I recommend:

1. **Contacting UK distributors directly**: LinITX (mentioned in search results) and other specialist retailers stock MikroTik and Teltonika equipment
2. **Checking manufacturer specifications**: Teltonika and MikroTik websites provide detailed band support and connector specifications
3. **Verifying Ubiquiti compatibility**: Contact Ubiquiti support to confirm which external modems integrate properly with UniFi gateways via Ethernet WAN
4. **Antenna suppliers**: Specialist RF antenna retailers can provide high-gain directional options with specific connector types and outdoor ratings

The search results confirm that both Teltonika and MikroTik offer outdoor-capable 5G solutions with external antenna support and Ethernet connectivity, but the specific technical details, pricing, and availability data you need are not available in these results.
